# CC: Tweaked Script Collection

This repository contains my personal collection of scripts designed for the
[CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/) Minecraft mod. These scripts enhance in-game
automation, provide utility functions, all to help in personal Minecraft experience.

## Quick Installation

To effortlessly download and set up all scripts directly within your Minecraft world,
execute the following command in any CC: Tweaked computer or turtle:

```lua
pastebin run 9kFK83aN
```

This command performs the following actions:

1. **Downloads** and runs a lightweight installer script from Pastebin.
2. **Fetches** the complete list of scripts from this GitHub repository.

The initial Pastebin script is available here on [GitHub](./pastebin.lua)
as well as on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/9kFK83aN).

## Available Scripts

The [`downloadScripts.lua`](./downloadScripts.lua) script manages the installation
of all available scripts in this repository. Each script is designed to be modular
and easy to use. Here is a quick overview of all tools:

- [`readPeripherals.lua`](./readPeripherals.lua)

## Usage

After installation, you can run any script by entering its name in the
CC: Tweaked terminal. For example:

```lua
readPeripherals
```

Replace `readPeripherals` with any other script name you wish to execute!
